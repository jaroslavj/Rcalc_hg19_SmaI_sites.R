### Rcalc_hg19_SmaI_sites.R ##
# ver 1.0
# JJ 03/22/2014
#
# Calculates 
#	total numbers of reads, 
# 	uncorrected methylation 
#	c9 corrected methylation values
# Input file 1: sample_SmaI_sites.txt
# 	created as an output of "count_SmaI_CH3.py" script
# Input file 2: sample_spikes.txt
# 	created by an old script Rcalc_hum.R from sample_meth.txt
#	mapped by Shoudan's scripts
#	takes c9 correction from the sample_spikes.txt file
# Requires "ID_hg19_SmaI_sites.txt", a table with SmaI IDs, chromosome, position
# Output file: table with 
#	hg19_SmaI_ID, 
#	chromosome,
#	position, 
#	methylated reads, m
#	unmethylated reads, u
#	total reads, t
#	uncorrected methylation values, mp=100*(m+0.5)/(t+1)
#	c9-corrected meth values, mc9=100*c9*(m+0.5)/(c9*(m+0.5)+u+0.5)
